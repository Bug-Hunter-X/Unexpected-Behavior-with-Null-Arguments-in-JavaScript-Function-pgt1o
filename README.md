# Unexpected Behavior with Null Arguments in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in JavaScript related to handling null values as function arguments. The original code lacks explicit null checks, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function does not correctly handle cases where `a` or `b` is null. This can lead to errors or incorrect results.  The solution provides a clear and concise way to address this issue.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the buggy implementation. 
3. Run the buggy implementation and observe the errors or unexpected behavior.
4. Open `bugSolution.js` to see how to fix it. 
5. Run the corrected code and compare results.

## Solution

The solution explicitly checks for null values and handles them appropriately, preventing unexpected errors.
